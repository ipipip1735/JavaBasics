As with signature generation, a signature is verified by using an instance of the Signature class. You need to create a Signature object that uses the same signature algorithm as was used to generate the signature. The algorithm used by the GenSig program was the SHA1withDSA algorithm from the SUN provider.

Signature sig = Signature.getInstance("SHA1withDSA", "SUN");
Next, you need to initialize the Signature object. The initialization method for verification requires the public key.

sig.initVerify(pubKey);
Supply the Signature Object With the Data to be Verified You now need to supply the Signature object with the data for which a signature was generated. This data is in the file whose name was specified as the third command line argument. As you did when signing, read in the data one buffer at a time, and supply it to the Signature object by calling the update method.
